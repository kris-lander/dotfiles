dotfiles
========

A few dotfiles that have my own pesonal customisations.

I've structured as a castle, so it can be used with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)  

The bash_profile in home are largely based on the generated files from [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) 
 
The OSX defaults are a slightly altered version of [Mathias Bynens's OSX defaults](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/.osx)
